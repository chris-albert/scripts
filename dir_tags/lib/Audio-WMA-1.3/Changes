Revision history for Perl extension Audio::WMA.

1.2 Sun Nov  9 18:53:43 PST 2008
	* KDF : Parse replaygain and comment tags from WMA Extended Content block
	* Andy: Would give up trying to parse a filehandle too soon because no size value was set
	* Andy: Requires a size param when passed a filehandle, it will get into an infinite loop otherwise
	* Andy: Sample rate field was being read as a 16-bit value instead of 32-bit
	* Andy: Don't be case-sensitive when looking for WMA picture tag
	* Andy: type_data_length and error_data_length are 32-bit values
	* Andy: Add some missing wFormatTag values
