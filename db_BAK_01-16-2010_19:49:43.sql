Not something to take lightly, mind you, the duties of a co-pilot are as follows:\r\n \r\n1.        keep driver awake\r\n2.        cover blind spots, cop and parking spot checks \r\n3.        direct attention to points of interest otherwise overlooked by a rightfully distracted driver\r\n4.        maintain entertainment, diversify genre and source (i.e. radio, CD, conversation, Mikie freestyle rapping)\r\n \r\nWe start on a low but long bridge on a high lit afternoon, in the distance is heaven and above, as below, milky clouds, a storm seems to be slowly working itself our direction.  Chris had just recently been helping a pirate tear down houses and picked up some storm reading in turn, so he expands upon direction and severity.  Like a blimp lumbering above the foothills the body of vapor wafts its way through the atmosphere, never making a movement until it has moved.  The clouds, the blimp, and my mind move the same way when I can get it right. Now across the San Mateo Bridge we find its namesake in place of what earlier was a golden mirror, paths merge we head north, practically there.\r\n \r\nDeep in concentration on duty #3 I am busy, taken by my heavy survey of the surrounding areas we pass through.  I categorize every minute detail in my line of sight.  I observe hundreds of thousands of ninety degree angles dancing, separating, reversing. I read the marketing, count windows, identify four types of wild bird as well as their distance and velocity, then theorize production/distribution companies and how tall all the legal contracts and sales associate paychecks will stack before toppling and I am still surprised to see the car pattern on a truck license plate.  Quickly the concrete walls shrink and our scene opens up to The Bay, old cancerous boats, and a man walking atop the water.  He’s maybe a quarter mile out in the murk wielding a silhouette, a makeshift paddle, and nothing more than a surfboard, less really.  A phenomenal find and a celebration to see, our attention blurs elsewhere as quickly as the man on the water leaves our sightline.  I fight back the urge to point out how first we saw a sign of heaven and now of the holy son, keeping it to myself, for the context.  Turning to catch a last glance at jesus and read the opposite facing billboards (duty calls) and cross Mikie’s wrapped visage.  \r\n \r\nNow, Mikie, he’s hiked Mt. Whitney bootless, but a comfortable passenger car and his head holds an ear muffling chin-tied beanie, and a thick hand made scarf choking his neck and head like a constrictor.  Oh, it’s also a temperature-controlled environment and about seventy degrees.  Mikie is a clouded mirror to me sometimes.  Mitch and Michelle occupy the rear two-thirds almost as one.  Like newly rolled yarn they are soft and untangled, stitched in such reds and greens and blues that their number and pattern cannot be derived. Chris at the helm, Mikie surviving the winter in Clothing Cave, Michelle and Mitch somewhere I cannot identify, and I feeling centered, focused and ready, the carriage is full, first stop, China.  \r\n \r\nAs we look for a Chinese parking spot we pass a tree, red, on fire.  After parking and realizing our deadline is quick coming we head out.  China, San Francisco, Ca is sort of something neat but our path truly delivered when at it’s end was something mind bending.  The red beacon drew us in from a mile away.  This thing is less a tree and more a cast for wrapping wire around, in other words, a fucking catastrophe.  Only close and on foot does it really get a hold of you, its hundreds of thousands of single burning lights.  Chris and I, we tried not to get to close but within ten feet of its center this tree will have your brain twitching and you unknowingly meandering closer.  This tree is a great read and the best thing I have seen yet.  We group, under deadline, and break away from China SF, Ca leaving only an expired parking meter.\r\n \r\nThirty minutes drive from CSF, Ca is Haight, where you don’t pay for parking and all the greetings are free.  Moving west off Haight will grant you a one quarter mile drive with +500 to elevation and a great spot by the park.  Stepping out we somehow spend twenty minutes separating ourselves from the car and only a coffee stop and some really cool quaballic art later and we’re on our way to food.  \r\n \r\nUnder Michelle’s suggestion we find Magnolia.  Michelle fed the hungry and we all ate.  The beer was cold, home brewed and unique, the food was well prepared and filling.  We left in no hurry after Mitch graced us with another round and headed up the hill for the summit, a jam, and a path finding ceremony.  Ceremony a success, we are loaded with purpose and head out to walk the street.  A couple of rounds of the mostly closed upper and we are ready to head down to the lower south.  After filtering through a few places and crowds of well dressed locals we stumble upon a bar with good beer, good character and an empty table.  This one’s namesake is a makeshift Russian weapon.  This place is a caricature of hostility, upon entering I notice all the paintings adorning the walls are the same artist, black and white pastels,  movie scene clichés, framed red, and deck screwed into the wall.  Looking past the bar I see that none of the bottles have rags hanging from their insides so it’s three jack and cokes and something for the girl.\r\n \r\nI create the 50th interconnected circle with my first and second drinks dripping condensation and give up fishing for something to say as Mikie picks some gangster rap on the juke box.  I down my drink as the time nears.  I suggest we head back up to the summit to a divided crowd so it’s only Chris and I who leave, with just enough time to not hear Mikie’s inspired track selection.  We are headed for the hills.  Mikie, Mitch and Michelle stay behind inside Molotov voting for the social experience over the personal.  We head up and I work through remembering myself and where I have been. I focus my mind on thinking of how complex this world is and what a rarity our personal life experience must be. Not by my choosing an explosion of wonder engulfs me, the fireworks are early, and in my head.  The houses we pass on our ascent I can only describe as ornate, rare, and diverse.  Our pitched path is dark, filled with cracks, and just for us.  We plateau pass the car and head up for an eastern facing bald spot.\r\n \r\nTen, nine, eight, seven, ten, six, nine, five, six, four, five, four, three, three, two, four, three, two, ONE,  explosions in the distant sky reach our eyes before our ears, meant only to decorate air and dwarf the high sky scraping towers.  They made me think of the sun and the stars.  Distant seemed much closer then when a sudden whoosh exploded on hundred feet to our left.  I was distracted in thought and Chris in attempting to capture the action on his perpetually time exposed phone-camera, we almost missed it.  Two minutes later another whoosh, this time we are ready and turn to catch the pyrotechnic rock the air only a couple hundred feet away.  The hill is suddenly a disco of bright purple and grey.  Gold flickers into the trees, they absorb it and release definition.  I am with spirits floating in the clouds above the city.  A tiny fraction of a second later my state of mind dissolves and the sky lights have come to pass.  “Happy New Year!” a passerby greets, “This year will be our greatest to come,” I think, chasing fleeting thoughts and ground myself firmly back in reality.\r\n\r\nWe regroup in unspoken agreement to head for base camp.  Mikie, as usual, wears himself on his sleeve, yelling out re-countdowns to bystanders and passerby if he’s not pointing out the most mundane firsts of the year or rapping out friendly insults. Mitch and Michelle are caught in new connection and spin quickly around each other closing on the same point. Chris, again and always our smiling captain, guides us through these treacherous San Franciscan seas.
